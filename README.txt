!!! "create_database.php" must be run first to create and initialise the database and tables. localhost, $username = "root", password = "" !!!

!!! Files must be loaded in to "www/htdocs" folder with structure as is, so they are accessible, for example, "localhost/index.php", "localhost/cs/w3.css" !!!

!!! User must register before able to access the full booking system. !!!

If a session has not been created then each page will redirect to login page until an active session is noted.
